# Measure of a golfer's playing ability

## History

The earliest record of golf handicapping is thought to be from the late
17th century, in a diary kept by [Thomas
Kincaid](Thomas_Kincaid "wikilink"), who was a student in
[Edinburgh](Edinburgh "wikilink"), Scotland, although the word
*handicap* would not come into use in golf until the late 19th century.
The number of strokes to be given and the holes on which they would be
in effect was negotiated between competing golfers prior to the start of
play. According to *The Golfer's Manual* by [Henry Brougham
Farnie](Henry_Brougham_Farnie "wikilink"), examples of agreed terms
included "third-one" (one stroke every three holes), "half-one" (one
stroke every two holes), "one more" (a stroke a hole) and "two more"
(two strokes a hole).[^1][^2]

During the late 19th century, taking the difference between the average
of a golfer's best three scores during the year and
[par](Par_(golf) "wikilink") became the most widely used method of
handicapping in England and Scotland. As the sport grew, so did
discontent with the fairness of handicapping, with less proficient
players being particularly unhappy as it was much less likely for them
to play to the standard of their three-score average. Another issue was
the lack of consideration in the system for the varying difficulties of
different courses which meant the handicap was not very portable.[^3]

In an attempt to remedy the problems with a fairly basic handicap
system, along with many variations of that system and other systems also
being used, the authorities in Great Britain and Ireland sought to
standardize. One of the first standard and equitable handicap systems
was introduced by the [Ladies Golf Union](Ladies_Golf_Union "wikilink")
(LGU) in the 1890s. This was largely achieved by means of union-assigned
[course ratings](#Course_Rating "wikilink"), instead of clubs using
their own. It was not until the formation of the British Golf Unions
Joint Advisory Committee in 1924 that the men's game fully coordinated
to create an equitable handicap system, that included a uniform course
rating, throughout Great Britain and Ireland; the *Standard Scratch
Score and Handicapping Scheme* was introduced in 1926.[^4][^5]

In the United States there was a single authority governing the sport,
the [USGA](USGA "wikilink"), which made moving to a single standard
handicapping scheme somewhat easier. Introduced in 1911, the first
national handicap system was based on the British three-score average
system. The biggest development was a "par rating" system that assessed
the average good score of a scratch golfer on every course, which made
the handicap more portable. It also made clear that a player's handicap
was intended to reflect their potential rather than average play. Having
initially allowed clubs to determine their own par ratings, the USGA
quickly changed their minds and began assigning ratings. The USGA
Handicap System has further developed through the years, with an
increase in the number of scores used for handicap calculations, the
introduction of [Equitable Stroke
Control](Equitable_Stroke_Control "wikilink"),[^6] and improvements to
the course rating system. However the most significant change was the
creation of the [slope rating](slope_rating "wikilink") system, which
enables handicaps to allow for differences in difficulty between scratch
and bogey golfers. USGA Course and Slope Ratings now form the basis of
many other handicap systems.[^7]

As the sport grew globally, associations around the world each created
or adapted their own rules relating to handicaps. By the early 21st
century, there were six major recognized handicapping systems in
operation around the world: USGA Handicap System, EGA Handicap System,
CONGU Unified Handicap System, Golf Australia Handicap System, South
African Handicap System, and Argentinian Handicap System. While these
systems share some common features, e.g. most use a common course rating
system, they are not easily portable because their differences create
difficulties in converting handicaps between systems. In order to
eliminate these problems the USGA and The R&A, working with the various
existing handicapping authorities, devised a new *World Handicap System*
which was phased in globally in 2020.[^8][^9]

## Overview

[Amateur golfers](Amateur_golf "wikilink") who are members of golf clubs
are generally eligible for official handicaps on payment of the
prevailing regional and national association annual fees. Official
handicaps are administered by [golf
clubs](golf_club_(institution) "wikilink") with the associations often
providing additional peer reviewing for low handicaps. Other systems,
often free of charge, are available to golfers who are ineligible for
official handicaps. Handicap systems are not generally used in
[professional golf](Professional_golf_tours "wikilink"). A golfer whose
handicap is zero is referred to as a **scratch golfer**, and one whose
handicap is approximately 18 as a **bogey golfer**.[^10]

While the USGA administers its own handicapping system, the
administration of handicapping systems in countries affiliated to The
R&A is the responsibility of the national golf associations of those
countries. These bodies have different methods of producing handicaps
but they are all generally based on calculating an individual player's
playing ability from their recent history of rounds. Therefore, a
handicap is not fixed but is regularly adjusted to increases or
decreases in a player's scoring. Some systems (e.g. World Handicap
System, USGA, European Golf Association) involve calculation of a
playing handicap which is dependent on the
[course](golf_course "wikilink") being played and set of
[tees](teeing_ground "wikilink") that are being used, whereas others
(e.g. CONGU's Unified Handicap System) just use the allocated handicap
rounded to the nearest whole number.

Contrary to popular opinion, a player's handicap is intended to reflect
a player's potential or "average best", not a player's overall average
score. Statistically, low handicappers will play to their handicap more
often because they are likely to be more consistent than higher
handicappers.

## Features of handicapping systems

### Scoring

The total number of strokes taken for a hole (or round) before
accounting for a golfer's handicap is called the *gross score* for that
hole (or round), and the number of strokes taken after subtracting any
handicap allowance is called the *net score*.[^11]

Note that the *gross score* in 'world handicap system' is calculated as
the number of strokes taken for a hole ***+ the handicap allowance for
that hole*.** The *adjusted gross score* in 'world handicap system' is
the *gross score* adjusted such that the maximum on any particular hole
is the number of strokes taken for a hole + the handicap allowance for
that hole + 2 strokes (i.e. net double bogey).

In handicap [stroke play](stroke_play "wikilink") competitions, a
golfer's [playing handicap](#Playing_or_course_handicap "wikilink") is
subtracted from the total number of strokes taken to produce a net
score, which is then used to determine the final results. In handicap
[Stableford](Stableford "wikilink") competitions, a player's handicap is
distributed according to predetermined hole ratings ([stroke
index](stroke_index "wikilink")) and strokes deducted accordingly from
each hole score before calculating the points for that hole. In [match
play](match_play "wikilink"), the handicap difference between players
(or teams) is used to determine the number of strokes the high handicap
player should receive from the low handicapper during the playing of
their round; each of these strokes are received on the lowest numbered
stroke index holes.[^12] Stroke allowances may sometimes be reduced by a
set percentage in order to maintain the level playing field; this is
especially common in pairs and team competitions.

### Course Rating

Course Rating, (Standard) Scratch Score, Scratch Rating, and Standard
Rating are largely equivalent ratings that are used to indicate the
average "good score" by a scratch golfer for a set of tees on a golf
course. For a par 72 course, the course rating is generally between 67
and 77. There are different methods of calculating the Course Rating,
with the length of the course and its obstacles being the biggest
factors. Some systems use only these two, or even length alone, but most
modern handicapping systems now use the *USGA Course Rating* system
which assesses the difficulty of all aspects of the course, e.g.
altitude, wide or narrow [fairways](fairway_(golf) "wikilink"), length
of any rough, the size and contours of the
[greens](green_(golf) "wikilink"), etc.[^1][^2]

Some handicapping systems provide for an adjustment to the course rating
to account for variations in playing conditions on any given day, e.g.
course setup and weather, and it is against this adjusted rating that
handicaps are assessed and maintained. Examples of adjusted ratings are
Playing Conditions Calculation (World Handicap System), Competition
Scratch Score (CONGU Unified Handicapping System), Daily Scratch Rating
(Golf Australia Handicap System), and Calculated Rating (South African
Handicap System).

Analogous to course rating is the bogey rating, which is a measure of
the playing difficulty of a course for a [bogey
golfer](bogey_golfer "wikilink").

### Slope Rating

Devised by the USGA, the Slope Rating of a golf course describes the
relative difficulty of a course for a bogey golfer compared to a scratch
golfer. Slope Ratings are in the range 55 to 155, with a course of
standard relative difficulty having a rating of 113; the higher the
number, the more relatively difficult the course is.

### Playing or course handicap

In most major handicapping systems, a golfer does not use their exact
handicap (or handicap index) directly, but use it to produce their
playing or course handicap. For some systems, this means simply rounding
the exact handicap to the nearest whole number; however, systems that
use slope ratings require a more complex calculation to produce a course
handicap with some also factoring in the course rating:

$$\mbox{Course handicap} = \frac{ ( \mbox{handicap index} \times \mbox{slope rating} ) }{ \mbox{113}}$$
or

$$\mbox{Course handicap} = \frac{ ( \mbox{handicap index} \times \mbox{slope rating} ) }{ \mbox{113}} + ( \mbox{course rating} - \mbox{par} )$$

The USGA and Golf Australia systems use the first calculation; the WHS,
EGA, and Golf RSA systems use the second. Under CONGU's Unified
Handicapping System the exact handicap is rounded to the nearest whole
number to produce the playing handicap, and in the Argentinian system
the exact handicap is used directly.

A playing handicap may also refer to the stroke allowance for a given
competition dependent on [playing
format](variations_of_golf "wikilink"), and is generally calculated as a
percentage of the course handicap.

### Stroke Index

The Stroke Index is a number that has been assigned to each hole on a
golf course, and usually printed on the scorecard, to indicate on which
holes handicap strokes should be applied. On an 18-hole course, each
hole is assigned a different number from 1 to 18 (1 to 9 on a 9-hole
course). The lowest numbers are usually given to the holes where a
higher handicapper is most likely to benefit, and the highest numbers to
the holes they are least likely to benefit. Odd numbers will be
allocated to either the first or second 9-holes (and even numbers to the
other) to ensure a balanced distribution of handicap strokes, and
guidelines generally recommend avoiding having the lowest numbers at the
start or end of each nine in order to prevent early stroke allowances in
playoffs between golfers with similar handicaps or strokes going unused
if they are at the end.[^3]

### Maximum hole score

Most of the commonly used handicap systems seek to reduce the impact of
very high scores on one or more individual holes on the calculation and
updating of handicaps. This is achieved by setting a maximum score on
each hole, which is only used for handicapping purposes; i.e. it is not
used for determining results of competitions or matches. This *maximum
hole score* is either a fixed number or a [net
score](#Scoring "wikilink") relative to par. *Equitable Stroke Control*
(ESC) and *net double bogey* (also called Stableford Points Adjustments)
are the two most common mechanisms for defining a maximum hole score.

### Handicap differential

Handicap (or score) differentials are a feature of many handicapping
systems. They are a standardized measure of a golfers performance,
adjusted to take account of the course being played. Normally the
overall score will be adjusted prior to the calculation, e.g. by means
of [ESC or net double bogey](#Maximum_hole_score "wikilink"). The course
rating may also be adjusted to take account of conditions on the day.

For handicapping systems that use course and slope ratings, a typical
calculation using the *score* (see above) is as follows:

$$\mbox{Handicap differential} = \frac{ ( \mbox{adjusted score} - \mbox{course rating} ) \times \mbox{113}}{ \mbox{slope rating}}$$

The differentials are used both to calculate initial handicaps and
maintain existing ones, by taking a mean average of a set number of the
best recent differentials (e.g. the USGA system uses the best 10
differentials from the last 20 scores).

For other handicapping systems, the differentials are simply the
difference between the (adjusted) gross or net scores and a specified
standard rating (e.g. course rating, standard scratch score, etc.), and
they are used in different ways to maintain handicaps.

### Peer review

In golf clubs, peer review is usually managed by an elected Handicap
Secretary who, supported by a small committee, conducts an Annual Review
of the handicaps of all members and assesses ad hoc requests from
individual members (usually when age or medium to long-term infirmity
affects their playing ability). This gives uniformity to handicapping
across their club for the setting and maintenance of handicaps with the
objective of establishing fair competition between golfers of all
abilities.

At the regional level, peer review is extended to include rigorous
validation of the handicap returns of low handicap golfers. This ensures
that only golfers of an appropriate standard gain entry to their elite
tournaments. Occasionally, golfers are excluded from the elite game as a
consequence of being found to abuse the system. To a degree, these
regional bodies also monitor the performance of and provide training for
Handicap Secretaries at the club level.

Nationally, the peer review is extended further to assessing golfers
from external jurisdictions for their suitability for entry into their
elite international events. They also play a large part in periodic
reviews of the handicapping system itself to improve it for the future.

## Handicapping systems

### World Handicap System

Due to the many different handicapping systems in use around the world,
and the many inconsistencies within them, which makes it difficult to
compete on an equal footing where another handicap system is in use, the
sports major governing bodies, in 2011 [The R&A](The_R&A "wikilink") and
the [USGA](USGA "wikilink") began work on creation of a single uniform
handicapping system to be used everywhere.[^1] In February 2018, they
announced that the World Handicap System (WHS) would be launched in
2020.[^2] Once introduced, the World Handicap System will continue to be
governed by The R&A and the USGA with the six existing major
handicapping authorities (the USGA, the [Council of National Golf
Unions](Council_of_National_Golf_Unions "wikilink") (CONGU) in Great
Britain and Ireland, the [European Golf
Association](European_Golf_Association "wikilink") (EGA), [Golf
Australia](Golf_Australia "wikilink"), the [South African Golf
Association](South_African_Golf_Association "wikilink") (SAGA), and the
[Argentine Golf Association](Argentine_Golf_Association "wikilink")
(AAG)) administering the system at a local level.[^3][^4]

The WHS is based on the USGA Course and Slope Rating system, and largely
follows the USGA Handicap System while also incorporating features from
the six major existing handicap systems. For example, 8 differentials
(like the Golf Australia system) are used after net double bogey
adjustments (like the CONGU and EGA systems) for handicap calculations,
and the WHS course/playing handicap includes a course rating adjustment
(like the EGA system).[^5] For players with current handicaps, their
handicap records in the old systems will be used to produce WHS
handicaps; the expectation is that most players will at most see a
difference of one or two strokes, if any.

A new WHS handicap requires several scores to be submitted; the
recommendation is a minimum of 54 holes made up of any number of 9 or
18-hole rounds in order to achieve a reasonable fair and accurate
result, although handicaps may be issued from a smaller sample. Handicap
adjustments will be made upon submission of any 9 or 18-hole scores with
updates published daily; unlike some other systems both competitive and
recreational rounds may be submitted by all players (e.g. CONGU's
Unified Handicapping System only allows submission of non-qualifying
scores by golfers in Category 2 or above). Ongoing handicaps are based
on the average of the best 8 differentials, but with an "anchor" to
prevent rapid increases that would not necessarily reflect the player's
true potential. There is also a hole limit of "net double bogey" for
handicapping purposes in order to prevent one or two bad holes from
having a disproportionate effect.[^6]

#### World Handicap System overview

A WHS handicap is calculated with a specific arithmetic formula that
approximates how many strokes above or below
[par](Par_(score) "wikilink") a player might be able to play, based on
the eight best scores of their last twenty rounds.[^7] The calculation
has several variables, including: the player's scores from their most
recent rounds, the course rating, and the slope rating.

A [score differential](#Handicap_differential "wikilink") is calculated
from each of the scores after any [net double
bogey](#Maximum_hole_score "wikilink") adjustments (an adjustment which
allows for a maximum number of strokes per hole based on the player's
course handicap) have been applied, using the following formula:

$$\mbox{18-hole score differential} = \frac{\mbox{113}}{\mbox{slope rating}} \times ({\mbox{adjusted gross score}} - {\mbox{course rating}} - {\mbox{PCC adjustment}})$$

$$\mbox{9-hole score differential} = \frac{\mbox{113}}{\mbox{slope rating}} \times ({\mbox{adjusted gross score}} - {\mbox{course rating}} - ({\mbox{0.5}} \times {\mbox{PCC adjustment}}))$$

Only 18-hole differentials are used for the calculation of a handicap
index. As such, 9-hole differentials need to be combined before being
used, subject to remaining one of the 20 most recent differentials. The
system also allows for situations where less than 18 (or 9) hole have
been played, subject to a minimum of 14 (or 7) holes having been
completed, by "scaling up" with net pars for any missing holes.

The score differentials are rounded to one decimal place, and the best 8
from the last 20 submitted scores are then averaged and rounded to one
decimal place to produce the handicap index. Initial handicaps are
calculated from a minimum of five scores using adjustments that limit
each hole score to a maximum of (par + 5). If there are at least 5 but
fewer than 20 qualifying scores available, the handicap index is
calculated using a set number or differentials according to how many
scores are available, with an additional adjustment made to that average
in some circumstances.

| Number of rounds | Differentials to use | Adjustment to average |
|------------------|----------------------|-----------------------|
| 3                | lowest 1             | -2.0                  |
| 4                | lowest 1             | -1.0                  |
| 5                | lowest 1             | 0                     |
| 6                | lowest 2             | -1.0                  |
| 7 or 8           | lowest 2             | 0                     |
| 9 to 11          | lowest 3             | 0                     |
| 12 to 14         | lowest 4             | 0                     |
| 15 or 16         | lowest 5             | 0                     |
| 17 or 18         | lowest 6             | 0                     |
| 19               | lowest 7             | 0                     |

The basic formula for calculating the handicap index is as follows
(where *n* is the number of differentials to use), with the result
rounded to one decimal place:

$$\mbox{Handicap index} = (\frac{1}{n}\sum\_{x=1}^{n} \mbox{Differential}\_x) + \mbox{adjustment}$$

The handicap index is not used directly for playing purposes, but used
to calculate a course handicap according to the slope rating of the set
of tees being used with an adjustment based on the difference between
the course rating and par. The result is rounded to the nearest whole
number. For competitions, the unrounded course handicap is converted to
a playing handicap by applying a handicap allowance, dependent on the
format of play.

$$\mbox{Course Handicap} = \frac{ ( \mbox{Handicap index} \times \mbox{Slope Rating} )}{113} + ( \mbox{course rating} - \mbox{par} )$$

The WHS contains measures reduce a handicap index more quickly in the
case of exceptional scoring, and also to prevent a handicap index from
rising too quickly. This is done by means of "soft" and "hard" caps
based on the lowest index during the previous 365 days; the soft cap
reduces increases above 3.0 to 50%, and the hard cap limits increases to
5.0. Updates to a golfer's handicap index are issued daily.

Many elements of WHS have flexibility which allows for local authorities
to determine their own settings, but the basic handicap index
calculation remains the same. Examples include: 9-hole scores may be
scaled-up rather than combined; (course rating − par) may be omitted
from the course handicap calculation; and the rounded course handicap
may be used in the playing handicap calculation.[^8]
### USGA Handicap System

The first handicap system to be introduced by the USGA was largely the
work of [Leighton Calkins](Leighton_Calkins "wikilink"), who based it on
the British "three-score average" system where the handicap was
calculated as the average of the best three scores to par in the last
year. The key difference was the introduction of a par rating (later
known as course rating), which was based on the ability of leading
amateur [Jerome Travers](Jerome_Travers "wikilink"), to account for
variances in the playing difficulty of different courses. After
initially allowing clubs to determine their own ratings, at the behest
of Calkins the USGA quickly began assigning ratings centrally. Course
ratings were rounded to the nearest whole number until 1967, when they
started being given to one decimal place.[^1]

In 1947, the number of scores used to calculate handicaps was increased
to the best 10 from all scores ever recorded subject to a minimum of 50.
However this was not uniformly implemented, with regional associations
disagreeing on the total number of rounds to be considered. In 1958, the
USGA specified that the best 10 from 25 scores would be used. This was
reduced to 10 from 20 in 1967, which remains to this day although a
further adjustment was made with the introduction of a "Bonus of
Excellence" multiplier to equalize handicaps and give better players a
marginal advantage. Originally 85%, the multiplier was changed to 96%
after being seen to favor better players too heavily. In 1974,
[Equitable Stroke Control](#Maximum_hole_score "wikilink") was adopted
in order to eliminate the effect of very high individual hole scores on
handicap calculations.[^2]

With the system still not accounting for variances in playing difficulty
for golfers of different abilities, in 1979 the USGA set to work on how
to address the issue with the creation of the Handicap Research Team.
The result of their work was the creation of what is now the [Slope
system](Slope_rating "wikilink"). Slope was gradually introduced,
firstly in Colorado in 1982, before being implemented nationally from
1987. The USGA then set about making further refinements to the course
rating system, which at the time was still largely dependent on length,
to take account of many other factors affecting scoring ability for a
scratch golfer.[^3] The USGA Course and Slope Rating system is now used
by most of the world's major handicapping systems.[^4]

The USGA Handicap System is used throughout the jurisdiction of the
[USGA](USGA "wikilink") (i.e. the United States and Mexico), and is also
licensed for use in many other countries around the world, e.g.
[Canada](Golf_Canada "wikilink").[^5] The USGA has often resorted to the
courts to protect the integrity of its handicap system. In one such
case, the [California Court of
Appeal](California_Courts_of_Appeal "wikilink") (First District)
summarized the system's history:

#### USGA Handicap System overview

A USGA handicap is calculated with a specific arithmetic formula that
approximates how many strokes above or below
[par](Par_(score) "wikilink") a player might be able to play, based on
the ten best scores of their last twenty rounds.[^6] The calculation has
several variables: the player's scores from their most recent rounds,
and the course and slope ratings from those rounds.

A [handicap differential](#Handicap_Differential "wikilink") is
calculated from each of the scores after [Equitable Stroke
Control](Equitable_Stroke_Control "wikilink") (ESC), an adjustment which
allows for a maximum number of strokes per hole based on the player's
course handicap, has been applied using the following formula:

$$\mbox{Handicap differential} = \frac{ ( \mbox{ESC adjusted score} - \mbox{course rating} ) \times \mbox{113}}{ \mbox{slope rating}}$$

The handicap differentials are rounded to one decimal place, and the
best 10 from the last 20 submitted scores are then averaged, before
being multiplied by 0.96 (the "bonus of excellence") and truncated to
one decimal place to produce the handicap index. Initial handicaps are
calculated from a minimum of five scores using ESC adjustments based on
the course handicap corresponding to a handicap index of 36.4 for men or
40.4 for women. If there are at least 5 but fewer than 20 qualifying
scores available, the handicap index is calculated using a set number or
differentials according to how many scores are available.[^7]

| Number of rounds | Differentials to use |
|------------------|----------------------|
| 5 or 6           | lowest 1             |
| 7 or 8           | lowest 2             |
| 9 or 10          | lowest 3             |
| 11 or 12         | lowest 4             |
| 13 or 14         | lowest 5             |
| 15 or 16         | lowest 6             |
| 17               | lowest 7             |
| 18               | lowest 8             |
| 19               | lowest 9             |

The basic formula for calculating the handicap index is as follows
(where *n* is the number of differentials to use), with the result
truncated to one decimal place:

$$\mbox{Handicap index} = \frac{0.96}{n}\sum\_{x=1}^{n} \mbox{Differential}\_x$$

The handicap index is not used directly for playing purposes, but used
to calculate a course handicap according to the slope rating of the set
of tees being used. The result is rounded to the nearest whole
number.[^8]

$$\mbox{Course Handicap} = \frac{ ( \mbox{Handicap index} \times \mbox{Slope Rating} )}{113}$$

Updates to a golfer's handicap index are issued periodically, generally
once or twice per month depending on the local state and regional golf
associations.[^9]

### CONGU Unified Handicapping System

Following a meeting of the four men's golf unions of Great Britain and
Ireland in [York](York "wikilink") arranged by [The Royal and Ancient
Golf Club of St
Andrews](The_Royal_and_Ancient_Golf_Club_of_St_Andrews "wikilink") in
1924, the British Golf Unions Joint Advisory Committee (later [Council
of National Golf Unions](Council_of_National_Golf_Unions "wikilink"))
was formed. The organization was tasked with creating a handicapping
system that would be equitable to golfers of varying ability, and as a
result the **Standard Scratch Score and Handicapping Scheme** was
devised. The system was introduced in 1926, and used a "scratch score"
system to rate courses, taking account that courses may play easier or
more difficult than [par](par_(golf) "wikilink").[^10]

A new system was introduced in 1983, which incorporated features of the
Australian system. This was further revised in 1989 with the
introduction of the *Competition Scratch Score* (CSS), an adjustment to
the *Standard Scratch Score* (SSS), to take account of variances in
course conditions (setup, weather, etc.) on a given day.[^11] Further
significant changes came in 1993 (buffer zones) and 1997 (Stableford
Points Adjustment). In 2002, the Council of National Golf Unions (CONGU)
and the [Ladies' Golf Union](Ladies'_Golf_Union "wikilink") (LGU) began
working together (the LGU had adopted a system similar to that of CONGU
in 1998) and in February 2004 the **Unified Handicapping System** (UHS)
came into force.[^12]

The Unified Handicapping System is used to manage handicaps for both men
and women who are members of affiliated [golf
clubs](golf_club_(institution) "wikilink") in the United Kingdom and the
Republic of Ireland. The system is published by CONGU and administered
by each of the individual unions on behalf of their members,[^13] with
handicaps being managed locally by someone at each club; this person
normally holds the position of competitions or handicap secretary.

#### Unified Handicapping System overview

Under the Unified Handicapping System, initial handicaps are allocated
based on returned scores from 54 holes, usually three 18-hole
rounds.[^14] The number of strokes taken on each hole is adjusted to
maximum of double the par of the hole before adding up the scores;
adjustments were previously 2 over par for men and 3 over par for
women.[^15] The best of the "adjusted gross differentials" (AGD) between
the adjusted score and the Standard Scratch Score (SSS) is taken to
calculate the initial handicap using the following formula, with the
result truncated to give a whole number:

$$\mbox{Initial handicap} = \frac{ ( \mbox{Lowest AGD} + ( \mbox{Lowest AGD} \times \mbox{0.13}) ) }{ \mbox{1.237}}$$
Adjustments may be made to the initial handicap should it be deemed
necessary to ensure it is reasonably fair. Handicaps are given to one
decimal place and divided into categories with the lowest handicaps
being in Category 1. Prior to 2018, the highest handicaps were in
Category 4 for men, with a maximum of 28.0, and Category 5 for women,
with a maximum of 36.0, with provision for higher "club" or "disability"
handicaps up to a limit of 54.0 for those who cannot play to these lower
limits.[^16] In 2018, handicap limits were standardized at 54.0 and a
Category 5 was introduced for men, and a new Category 6 for all,
replacing the club and disability category (see table below). The exact
handicap is rounded to the nearest whole number to give the playing
handicap.[^17] Many handicap competitions still have maximum limits of
28 for men and 36 for women.

For all qualifying scores that are returned, adjustments are made to a
players exact handicap based on the Competition Scratch Score (CSS). All
hole scores are first adjusted to a maximum of net 2-over par with
handicap strokes being used per the [stroke
index](stroke_index "wikilink") published on the scorecard; this is
called Stableford or net double-bogey adjustment. Every stroke the
adjusted net score is below the CSS triggers a reduction dependent on
the players handicap category; for Category 1 this is 0.1 per stroke,
for Category 2 it is 0.2, etc. Should the adjusted net score exceed the
CSS , there is a *buffer zone* equivalent to the handicap category
before a 0.1 increase is applied, which is the same for all categories;
for Category 1 there is 1 stroke buffer, for Category 2 it is 2 strokes,
etc.[^18] The Competition Scratch Score is an adjustment to the Standard
Scratch Score computed from all scores returned and is in the range
(*S**S**S* − 1) to (*S**S**S* + 3) with provision for "reduction only"
when scoring conditions have proved especially difficult.[^19]

In addition to playing in qualifying competitions, golfers in Category 2
and above may also submit a number of *supplementary scores* in order to
maintain their handicap; primarily a feature to accommodate golfers who
play in few competitions and allow them to maintain current handicaps,
it is also used by people who wish to try and get their handicap down
while they are playing well. There are other mechanisms in the system to
reduce or increase handicaps more quickly. Every year all handicaps are
reviewed and adjusted if necessary to ensure they remain fair and
accurate. In addition, any very good scores are monitored throughout the
year and an *exceptional scoring reduction* may be applied if certain
triggers are reached.

Historically calculating the CSS and any handicap adjustments was done
manually by means of published tables, but this is now computerized with
handicaps being published to a Centralised Database of Handicaps (CDH).

### EGA Handicap System

The EGA Handicap System is the [European Golf
Association](European_Golf_Association "wikilink")'s method of
evaluating golf abilities so that players of different standards can
compete in handicap events on equal terms. It is based on
[Stableford](Stableford "wikilink") scoring and has some similarities to
both the CONGU system, with regards to handicap categories and
adjustments, and to the USGA system, with regards to the use of
[course](#Course_Rating "wikilink") and [slope](slope_rating "wikilink")
ratings and calculating playing handicaps. The first version of the
system was introduced in 2000.[^20]

#### EGA Handicap System overview

Under the EGA Handicap System, initial handicaps require just a single 9
or 18-hole score recorded using the maximum handicap of 54. The handicap
is then calculated from the number of Stableford points scored.

Initial handicap = 54 − (Stableford points − 36)

EGA handicaps are given to one decimal place and divided into
categories, with the lowest handicaps being in Category 1 and the
highest in Category 6 (see table below). The handicap is not used
directly for playing purposes and a calculation must be done to
determine a "playing handicap" specific to the course being played and
set of tees being used. For handicaps in categories 1 to 5, the formula
is as follows with the result rounded to the nearest whole number:

$$\mbox{Playing handicap} = \frac{ ( \mbox{handicap index} \times \mbox{slope rating} ) }{ \mbox{113}} + ( \mbox{course rating} - \mbox{par} )$$

And for category 6 a "playing handicap differential" is used, which is
equal to the playing handicap for a handicap index of 36.0:

Playing handicap = (handicap index + playing handicap differential)

For all qualifying scores that are returned, adjustments are made to a
players handicap index. All scores are first converted into Stableford
points if necessary (i.e. rounds played using another scoring method,
e.g. stroke play), effectively applying a [net double
bogey](#Maximum_hole_score "wikilink") adjustment, and then for every
point scored above the *buffer zone* there is a reduction applied to the
players handicap index according to their handicap category; for
Category 1 this is 0.1 per point, for Category 2 it is 0.2, etc. Should
the number of points scored be below the buffer zone, a fixed increase
of 0.1 is applied to the handicap index regardless of category. The EGA
system also takes account of variations in playing difficulty on any
given competition day by means of a *Computed Buffer Adjustment* (CBA)
which adjusts the buffer zones by between −1 and +2 with provision for
"reductions only" when scoring is especially difficult.[^21] The CBA
replaced the previous [Competition Stableford
Adjustment](Competition_Stableford_Adjustment "wikilink") method, which
adjusted player's Stableford scores directly, in 2013.[^22]

In addition to playing in qualifying competitions, golfers in Category 2
and above may also submit a number of *extra day scores* in order to
maintain their handicap. Handicaps are also reviewed annually and any
necessary adjustments made.[^23]

### Golf Australia Handicap System

The Golf Australia Handicap System is maintained on GOLF Link, which was
a world-first computerized handicapping system developed by [Golf
Australia](Golf_Australia "wikilink")'s predecessor, the Australian Golf
Union (AGU) in the 1990s. When GOLF Link was first introduced it
contained two key characteristics that set it apart from other world
handicapping systems at the time:

1.  It used a Calculated Course Rating (CCR) to determine how difficult
    the course was on the day, and upon which handicap adjustment was
    made.
2.  It utilized a 'swipe' card that enabled a player to access their
    handicap from any GOLF Link terminal in Australia.

In April 2010 GA adopted the USGA calculation method using the average
of the best 10 differentials of the player's past 20 total rounds,
multiplied by 0.96. In September 2011 this was altered to the best 8 out
of 20 rounds, multiplied by 0.93. The reasons for these changes were
cited to restore equity between high and low handicaps. An ‘anchor' so
that handicaps could not increase by more than 5 in a rolling 12-month
period, [slope ratings](slope_rating "wikilink"), and a more
sophisticated version of CCR called the Daily Scratch Rating (DSR) were
implemented on January 23, 2014.[^24][^25][^26]

#### GA Handicap System overview

The GA Handicap System is based on the
[Stableford](Stableford "wikilink") scoring system, and uses slope and
[course rating](#Course_Rating "wikilink") (called "Scratch Rating").
For handicapping purposes, the scratch rating is adjusted to reflect
scoring conditions ("Daily Scratch Rating"), and all scores are
converted into Stableford points, called the Stableford Handicap
Adjustment (SHA) and inherently applying [net double
bogey](#Maximum_hole_score "wikilink") adjustments, regardless of the
scoring system being used while playing.[^27]

Handicaps are calculated from the best 8 adjusted
[differentials](#Handicap_differential "wikilink"), called "sloped
played to" results, from the most recent 20 scores. Should there be 3 or
more but fewer than 20 scores available, a specified number of "sloped
played to" results are used, per the table below.[^28]

New handicaps require 3 18-hole scores to be submitted (or any
combination of 9 and 18-hole scores totaling 54 holes played) using a
"Temporary Daily Handicap" of 36 for men or 45 for women in order to
calculate the necessary "sloped played to" results. "Sloped played to"
results are calculated using the following formula and rounded to one
decimal place:[^29]

$$\mbox{Sloped played to} = ( \mbox{Par} + \mbox{Daily handicap} - ( \mbox{Stableford points} - \mbox{36} ) - \mbox{Daily scratch rating}) \times \frac{ \mbox{113} }{ \mbox{Slope Rating}}$$

To calculate the GA handicap, the "sloped played to" results are
averaged and multiplied by a factor of 0.93, which is intended to
equalize the handicap in favor of better players. The formula for
calculating a GA handicap is as follows (where *n* is the number of
differentials to use), with the result truncated to one decimal
place:[^30]

$$\mbox{GA handicap} = \frac{0.93}{n}\sum\_{x=1}^{n} \mbox{Sloped played to}\_x$$

The GA handicap is used to create a "[daily
handicap](#Playing_or_course_handicap "wikilink")", specific to the
course and set of tees being used, using the following formula with the
result rounded to the nearest whole number:[^31]

$$\mbox{Daily handicap} = \frac{ \mbox{GA handicap} \times \mbox{Slope Rating} }{ \mbox{113}}$$

### South African Handicap System

Before 2018, the South African Handicap System used a propriety course
rating system without slope, called Standard Rating, which included
specific calculations for length and altitude. Handicaps were calculated
using the best 10 from the last 20 differentials, with differentials
derived by means of a simple (Standard Rating − [Adjusted
Gross](Equitable_Stroke_Control "wikilink")) formula. The system
previously calculated handicaps against an adjusted Standard Rating
(called Calculated Rating) but this was suspended in 2012.[^32] Playing
handicaps were simply the exact handicap, rounded to the nearest whole
number.[^33]

In September 2018, the renamed GolfRSA Handicap System adopted the USGA
Course and Slope Rating system. This necessitated a few additional
changes (e.g. playing handicap and differential calculations), but the
system retained all other features (e.g. Adjusted Gross and no daily
course rating adjustment). The playing handicap under the GolfRSA system
includes the difference between the Course Rating and Par.[^34]

In October 2019, further changes were made which brought the GolfRSA
Handicap System further into line with the upcoming World Handicap
System. The changes introduced included reducing the number of
differentials used in handicap calculations from 10 down to 8, net
double bogey as the maximum score per hole, reducing the minimum number
of valid 18-hole scores required for handicapping to three, and
exceptional scoring reductions.[^35]

### Argentinian Handicap System

The Argentine Golf Association (AAG) handicapping system is a relatively
simple one, using only a course rating, without slope. New handicaps
require the submission of scorecards from five 18-hole rounds (or ten
9-hole rounds). An initial handicap of 25 is normally used as a starting
point, which is then adjusted based on the submitted scores. Handicaps
are updated once every month, with current handicaps generated from a
lookup table using the average of the best eight differentials from the
last 16 rounds. Golfers simply use their exact handicap for playing
purposes.[^36][^37]

### Other systems

For the handicapping of golfers who are ineligible for an official
handicap, some system options are available:

#### Peoria System

The *Peoria System*[^38] was designed for the handicapping of all
players competing in an event such as a *charity* or *corporate* golf
day. Before play commences, the organisers secretly select 6 holes (in
readiness for handicapping purposes later) from the course to be played.
When players have completed their rounds, they apply the *Peoria*
algorithm to their scores on the selected holes to determine their
handicap for that round. They then subtract that handicap from their
gross score to give their net score - and the winner is determined in
the usual way.[^39]

#### Callaway System

The *Callaway System*[^40] was designed with the same objective as
*Peoria*. The *Callaway* handicapping algorithm works by totaling a
variable number of "worst" scores achieved (subject to a double-par
limit) according to a simple table. A couple of adjustments are then
made to this total to give the player's handicap, which is then applied
to their gross score as normal.[^41]

#### Scheid System

The *Scheid System*[^42] is similar to the Callaway System, except a
different version of the table is used.[^43]

#### System 36

*System 36*[^44] is a same-day handicapping system similar in function
to *Callaway System* and *Peoria System*. Throughout the round, the
golfer accrues points based on the following formula:

-   Double bogey or worse: 0 points
-   Bogey: 1 point
-   Par or better: 2 points

At the end of the round, points earned are tallied. The total is
subtracted from 36, and the resulting number is the golfer's handicap
allowance. The golfer's net score can then be computed using their
System 36 handicap allowance.
